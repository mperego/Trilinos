XROL - Experimental Rapid Optimization Library 
----------------------------------------------

This subpackage contains experimental implementations of ROL 
components aimed at reducing runtime overhead and leveraging
new features that have been incorporated in the C++11 and 
C++14 standard. For this reason, a C++14 compatible compiler 
is needed. In the case of GCC, the flag -std=c++14 will be 
needed.
